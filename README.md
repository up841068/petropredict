# Petrobras Stock Price Forecasting

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the Petrobras Stock Price Forecasting Project!

## Objectives

The goal of this project is to develop and apply a state-of-the-art deep learning multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model to forecast the stock prices of Petrobras, a leading Brazilian oil and gas company.

The stock market is a complex and dynamic environment, and accurate forecasting of stock prices is crucial for making informed investment decisions. This project aims to leverage the power of deep learning techniques to predict the future prices of Petrobras stock with high accuracy.

In this repository, you will find the code and data used to train and evaluate the MLP model, as well as the results of the forecasting analysis. The model is trained on historical stock price and volume data, as well as other relevant financial indicators, and is evaluated on its ability to predict future stock prices.

## Further information

I hope this project will provide valuable insights and ideas for other practitioners interested in applying deep learning techniques to financial forecasting problems. Please feel free to explore the repository and provide feedback or suggestions for improvements.
